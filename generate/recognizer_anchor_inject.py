"""ADR-0163.D.2 — per-category recognizer anchor injection.

When the candidate-graph pipeline's existing parser yields no candidates
for a statement AND the ratified recognizer registry recognizes the
statement, this module is consulted to build typed solver primitives
(``CandidateInitial`` / future ``CandidateOperation`` values) from the
recognizer's ``parsed_anchors``.  The output extends ``per_sentence_choices``
the same way the existing parser's output does, so the downstream
solver runs unchanged.

Doctrine
--------
- Pure, deterministic injectors.  Same ``(match, sentence)`` → same
  ``SentenceChoice`` tuple, byte-equal.
- Refusal-preferring: each injector returns ``()`` when it cannot build
  a primitive that passes the existing ``_initial_admissible``
  structural check (the wrong=0 safety net the candidate-graph already
  enforces).
- No LLM / embeddings / learned classifiers; the injection is rules-only
  same discipline as Phase A/C/D detection.
- Per-category boundary: v1 implements only ``discrete_count_statement``.
  Every other category routes to the empty-tuple fallback (skip-only,
  identical to the round-2 Phase D wiring) and lands in follow-up
  D.2.x PRs after the framework's empirical lift is operator-reviewed.

Five-layer wrong=0 safety net (the Phase D.2 brief's load-bearing
section) is preserved across this module:

  1. Matcher narrowness — ``recognizer_match._try_extract_discrete_count_anchor``
     refuses on any ambiguity.
  2. Extraction correctness — anchor fields ground in the literal
     statement surface.
  3. Injection correctness — the per-category injector returns a
     ``CandidateInitial`` that passes ``_initial_admissible``; failure
     to ground yields ``()``.
  4. Replay gate — propose-time ``run_admissibility_replay_gate``
     auto-rejects any extraction change that lifts the GSM8K wrong
     count.
  5. Multi-branch decision rule — when an injected candidate disagrees
     with another branch's answer, the candidate-graph refuses.

    Contract (the contract a matcher extension must honor to enable
    composition admission via this path):

    - ``match.parsed_anchors`` carries at least one anchor mapping with a
      key ``"composition_shape"`` whose value is the surface pattern
      string used by ratified composition registry entries (e.g.
      ``"bound(count) × bound(unit_cost)"``).
    - The same anchor carries a pre-composed payload the registry only
      gates: either ``"composed_initial"`` (a fully-constructed
      :class:`CandidateInitial`) or ``"composed_operation"`` (a
      :class:`CandidateOperation`). This module does NOT perform
      arithmetic — the matcher / matcher-extension owns the math; the
      registry owns the admissibility decision.

    Semantics:

    - registry empty OR no entry for shape → return ``()`` (refusal-preferring)
    - entry exists, polarity ``"affirms"`` → admit the pre-composed payload
    - entry exists, polarity ``"falsifies"`` → return ``()`` (suppressed)

    This is a registry-driven *gate*, not a registry-driven arithmetic
    primitive. Per ADR-0169 §"Mutation boundary" the registry never
    rewrites solver / arithmetic semantics; it ratifies whether a
    given structural shape may admit.

    No matcher currently publishes ``composition_shape`` — at land time
    this path is dormant infrastructure. The case-0019 truth-test will
    fire only after a matcher extension binds quantity-shape composition
    anchors (out of scope for this PR; see follow-up brief).
